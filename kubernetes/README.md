Your Docker Compose configuration has been successfully converted into Kubernetes manifests! You can download the generated YAML files below:

- 📦 [**Deployments**](blob:https://m365.cloud.microsoft/71f1ecd1-dda7-4bd5-8897-830c54999e45): Defines how each containerized service is deployed.
- 🔌 [**Services**](blob:https://m365.cloud.microsoft/69b003d3-2e6d-49c1-9e2d-04c6978680da): Exposes your deployments within the cluster or externally.
- 💾 [**Persistent Volume Claims**](blob:https://m365.cloud.microsoft/1cbec579-5604-4418-8730-9c200bec2641): Requests storage for services that use volumes.

You can apply these manifests to your Kubernetes cluster using:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployments.yaml
kubectl apply -f services.yaml
kubectl apply -f persistent_volume_claims.yaml
```

Would you like help customizing these manifests further (e.g., adding autoscaling, ingress, or secrets)?

Here are your Kubernetes manifests for environment configuration:

- 🛠️ [**ConfigMap**](blob:https://m365.cloud.microsoft/24236391-75a0-49b7-887a-56b1289d02f9): Contains non-sensitive environment variables.
- 🔐 [**Secret**](blob:https://m365.cloud.microsoft/56855f09-663e-45d5-9b5a-25e3428ce3d4): Contains the same variables, but encoded for sensitive data (you can base64-encode values as needed).

### 📦 How to Use in Your Deployments

To use the ConfigMap and Secret in your pods:

#### Add to your Deployment YAML:
```yaml
envFrom:
  - configMapRef:
      name: app-config
  - secretRef:
      name: app-secret
```

Would you like help integrating these into your existing deployment manifests or base64-encoding the secret values?
